#The TidyData Code Book

##In this dataset, there are two new variables "activity" (column1), "subject"(column2), and other old varaibles (column3-81) that used the same names from features.txt in the UCI HAR data set.
"activity" decribed the corresponding activity (e.g. WALKING, SITTING) for each subject."subject" indicated subject's ID. 
For the rest of the columns, they are the the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. So you can see the "mean" and "std" in variable names from column 3 to column 81. 
The meaning of these varaibles are list below:

Meaning of feature names in tidy data set

* ##activity includes six types of activities,which are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING    

* ##subject contains subjects ID, ranging from 1 to 30    

* ##The following are the decription from the original "feature_info" file:  

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
